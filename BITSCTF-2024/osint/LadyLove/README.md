### CHALLENGE:</br>
Sir-Steals-A-Lot is a world famous art thief. Lately he stole this painting. When he was caught he claimed to have done it because the painting commemorates the location of the crowned glory of his lady love. They fell in love in her hometown but her grandfather wouldn't let her marry a thief like him.! 
Answer is the meaning of his LadyLove's last name. Wrap the answer in the flag. Example :BITSCTF{your_answer}
HINT: 16th February 2024 is his LadyLove's 111th birthday (if she were still alive)


### SOLVE:</br>
On searching for the image online, we find that the painting is called  'Landscape from Spa' by Peter Adolf Hall in the website given below.</br>
https://reasonator.toolforge.org/?lang=en&q=18546305 </br></br>

This hints that the LadyLove's 'crowning' took place in Spa, a place in Belgium. The hint told us that 16th February 1913 is the LadyLove's birthday.</br>
On searching for people with birthdays on the date we come across Keriman Ece</br>
According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keriman_Halis_Ece :
Keriman Halis Ece (February 16, 1913 – January 28, 2012) was a Turkish beauty pageant titleholder, pianist, and fashion model who won the Miss Turkey 1932 title. She was also crowned Miss Universe 1932 in Spa, Belgium and thus became Turkey's first Miss Universe. </br></br>

It looks like we got the LadyLove's name. But the  flag requires the meaning of the name. On the same link above we see that her name 'Ece' means 'Queen' in Turkish. Hence the flag is: </br></br>
