**1. Identifying the Hidden Data**

We were given a file named `pasta.jpg`. Upon closer inspection using a hex editor, we discovered an unusual string embedded at the end of the file.

```
baab aaab bbaa baab abba baba aaab aaba aaaa abaa
baaa aaab aaaa aaaa baba abab aaba baab abab abba
aaab aabb abab baba baab abaa aabb aaaa bba0
```

The hint **"in the end"** suggested that we should analyze the data at the end of the file, which led us to this encoded text.

**2: Recognizing the Cipher**

The structure of the text, consisting of groups of four letters (`a` and `b`), is reminiscent of the **Baconian cipher**â€”a method of encoding text using a binary-like system of `A`s and `B`s.

However, standard Baconian cipher groups characters into sets of **five**, whereas this encoded message uses **groups of four**. This anomaly hinted at a variation of the classic Baconian cipher.

**3: Decoding the Message**

We used the **Baconian cipher decoder** on [dcode.fr](https://www.dcode.fr/bacon-cipher) and adjusted the decoding to use groups of four letters instead of the usual five.

Upon decoding, we successfully retrieved the flag.

**Flag:** `KashiCTF{THEYWEREREALLLLYCOOKING}`
