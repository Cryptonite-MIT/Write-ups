### Given information

> Did you know the cosmic weapons like this? I found similar example of such weapons on the net and it was even weirder. This ruler's court artist once drew the most accurate painting of a now extinct bird. Can you tell me the coordinates upto 4 decimal places of the place where this painting is right now.

The 'cosmic weapon' attached is *Tutankhamun's meteoric iron dagger*. 

Searching for other meteoric daggers, you could find this list

Connecting this list with the other hint about the painting in the description, the ruler in question is *Jahangir*, whose court artist was `Ustad Mansur`, who's also attributed for making the most accurate painting of a dodo.

This article says that the painting of the dodo is kept in the *Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg.*

The coordinates required for the flag are around the front area of the museum and required a bit of a brute-force approach to be found.
